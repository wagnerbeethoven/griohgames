<p>TWELVE MINUTES is a real-time top-down interactive thriller with an accessible click and drag interface.</p>
<p>What should be a romantic evening with your wife turns into a nightmare when a police detective breaks into your home, accuses your wife of murder and beats you to death…</p>
<p>Only for you to find yourself immediately returned to the exact moment you opened the front door, stuck in a TWELVE-MINUTE time loop, doomed to relive the same terror again and again…</p>
<p>Unless you can find a way to use the knowledge of what’s coming to change the outcome and break the loop.</p>
<p>TWELVE MINUTES blends the dream-like tension of THE SHINING with the claustrophobia of REAR WINDOW and the fragmented structure of MEMENTO.</p>
<p>Featuring James McAvoy, Daisy Ridley, and Willem Dafoe.</p>
